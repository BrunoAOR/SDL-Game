# SDL-Game

## What is this?
This project as part of a learning process about engines and 2D games. The project started trying to learn how to use SDL to build any game (ideas were blurry at the time). Quickly, the focus switched from building 'any game' to building a primitive game engine. Currently, I've stopped working on this repository and the development of the Engine (now called Potato Engine) continues in a separate repository which can be found here: https://github.com/BrunoAOR/Potato-Engine.
